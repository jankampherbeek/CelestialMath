# CelestialMath

A program that provides mathematical calculations for celestial mechanics.
CelestialMath is a toolbox with a wide range of calculations.
It is developed with GoLang and Fyne. The first versions will run on MacOs and Windows.
Support for Linux, Android and iOs will be realized in later versions.

The first releases wil contain some basic calculations but I will add more calculations soon.
