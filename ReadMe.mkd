# CelestialMath

A Rest API that provides services for celestial mechanics.
CelestialMath is a toolbox with a wide range of calculations.
It is developed with GoLang. The API should run on MacOs, Windows, Linux, iOs and Android.

The first releases wil contain some basic calculations but I will add more calculations soon.
